# Engineering Log — Week 3

## What I Shipped This Week

This week focused on system design depth and consistency.

I completed and published a system design article on **rate limiting**, covering:
- Common rate limiting strategies
- Trade-offs between different approaches
- Distributed rate limiting using Redis
- Failure modes and graceful degradation strategies

This article helped me consolidate my understanding of how theoretical concepts translate into real production constraints.

## How My System Thinking Evolved

While writing the rate limiter article, I realized that system design problems are less about choosing the “best” algorithm and more about choosing acceptable trade-offs.

Decisions around consistency, latency, and failure handling became clearer once I framed the problem from an operational perspective rather than a purely academic one.

## One Design Decision I Changed My Mind About

Initially, I assumed Redis-based rate limiting was always the correct solution for distributed systems.

While writing, I realized that:
- Redis introduces its own failure modes
- In some cases, approximate or in-memory limits with graceful degradation can be safer
- Simpler solutions are sometimes more resilient than perfectly accurate ones

## What I’d Do Differently Next Time

I would start system design write-ups with explicit non-goals earlier in the process.

This would help constrain design choices and avoid unnecessary complexity during implementation.

## What I’m Building Next

Next, I’m shifting focus toward **ML in production**, specifically:
- How model evaluation metrics fail in real-world scenarios
- How business cost should influence metric selection
- How to reason about false positives and false negatives after deployment

The goal is to bridge the gap between model performance and production impact.
