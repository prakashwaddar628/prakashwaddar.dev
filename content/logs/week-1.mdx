# Engineering Log — Week 1

## Week 1 Goals
- Set up my public engineering presence
- Start a flagship AI/system project
- Publish at least one deep technical write-up

## What I’m Building
I’m starting with **OpenSkill Atlas** — a skill-intelligence platform that focuses on proof over resumes.

The goal is to infer real skills from code, projects, and activity instead of self-reported claims.

## Technical Decisions Made
- Decided to document everything publicly
- Chose a modular backend-first approach
- Prioritizing clarity of architecture over feature completeness

## What Broke / Was Confusing
- Defining scope without overengineering
- Deciding what is “MVP” vs “nice to have”

## What I Learned
- Visibility compounds faster than perfection
- Writing clarifies thinking
- Real engineers document trade-offs, not just success

## Next Week Focus
- Finalize OpenSkill Atlas architecture
- Start backend skeleton
- Publish first deep technical article
