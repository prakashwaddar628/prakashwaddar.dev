### Week 1 Goals

- [x] Set up my public engineering presence
- [x] Start a flagship AI/system project
- [x] Publish at least one deep technical write-up

### What I’m Building

I’m starting with **OpenSkill Atlas** — a skill-intelligence platform that focuses on **proof over resumes**.

The goal is to infer real skills from code, projects, and activity instead of self-reported claims. In a world where everyone lists "Expert Python" on LinkedIn, I want to build a system that verifies it through semantic analysis of actual engineering output.

### Technical Decisions Made

* **Public Documentation:** Decided to document everything publicly. The pressure of visibility forces higher quality thought processes.
* **Modular Backend-First:** Chose a modular approach. I am deliberately ignoring the frontend UI for now to ensure the API surface area is robust.
* **Architecture over Features:** Prioritizing clarity of architecture over feature completeness.

### What Broke / Was Confusing

* **Scope Creep:** Defining scope without overengineering is harder than coding. I spent too much time debating which Vector DB to use before I even had data to store.
* **The MVP Line:** Deciding what is "MVP" vs "nice to have." I had to cut the real-time analysis feature to ensure I ship v0.1.

### What I Learned

> "Visibility compounds faster than perfection."

Writing clarifies thinking. I actually realized my initial database schema was flawed *while* writing this log. Real engineers document trade-offs, not just success.

### Next Week Focus

1.  Finalize **OpenSkill Atlas** architecture diagram.
2.  Start backend skeleton (likely FastAPI + PostgreSQL).
3.  Publish first deep technical article.
