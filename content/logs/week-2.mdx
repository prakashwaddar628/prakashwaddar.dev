# Engineering Log — Week 2

## What I Shipped This Week

This week was focused on making my work publicly accessible and production-ready.

I published two deep technical articles:
- A reasoning-focused explanation of the Longest Increasing Subsequence problem, centered on invariants rather than implementation details.
- A system design write-up on Redis fallback architecture, covering failure scenarios, circuit breakers, and trade-offs in production systems.

I also deployed my personal site on Vercel and made my writing and logs publicly navigable.

## What Broke

A dynamic MDX route (`/writing/[slug]`) worked locally but failed after deployment to Vercel.

The issue was not immediately obvious because:
- Static routes rendered correctly
- Only dynamic slug pages failed
- The error appeared as a generic server-side exception

---

## Root Cause Analysis

The failure was caused by a mismatch between the runtime environment and the code being executed.

Specifically:
- Dynamic routes defaulted to the Edge runtime on Vercel
- The page used Node.js APIs (`fs`) to load MDX content
- Edge runtime does not support Node filesystem APIs

Additionally, static optimization and metadata evaluation occurred before the page render, which further masked the issue.

---

## How I Fixed It

I fixed the issue by:
- Explicitly forcing the Node.js runtime for the dynamic route
- Disabling static optimization by marking the route as dynamic
- Adding defensive file existence checks to avoid silent crashes

This ensured consistent behavior between local development and production.

---

## What I Learned

- Next.js App Router has different execution environments that must be handled explicitly
- Edge runtime is powerful but unsuitable for filesystem-based content loading
- Production bugs often arise from environment assumptions rather than logic errors
- Writing public logs clarifies thinking and forces proper root-cause analysis

---

## What I’m Building Next

Next, I plan to continue strengthening my system design and applied ML profile.

Potential areas of focus:
- API rate limiting and backpressure handling
- Evaluating ML models based on business cost rather than accuracy alone

The goal is to keep building proof-driven artifacts that demonstrate real-world engineering judgment.
